## üí° Getting Started

### DOCS

[https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/MAKHARADZEGIORGI00/cars-parking_api/1.0]

### Prerequisites

- Docker
  [https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/]

- run Docker

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/GiorgiMakharadze/car-parking-API-nodejs-typescript.git
```

1. Create dotenv file

```bash
 PGUSER=root
 PGPASSWORD=secret
 PGUSERTEST=roottest
 PGPASSWORDTEST=secrettest
 MAX_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS=3
 PRIVATE_KEY=MIIEvQIBADANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAASCBKcwggSjAgEAAoIBAQDdmsx8TI5W6U9/JUVpG9RGc/By6A2Cv2Ic5UeZSdv0ph9/
```

2. run `docker compose build`
3. run `docker compose up`
4. Go to project folder and run `make migrationup`
5. You can use API
6. The API is now ready for use! Remember, the API employs CSRF protection. First, make a GET request to /csrf-token, then include the received token in the headers of your API calls as x-csrf-token: value. This is crucial as, without the correct token, you are restricted to making only GET requests.
7. If you wan to shut down run `docker compose down`

## Testing

1. run `docker compose up`
2. run `docker compose run test` it will run test files that file name includes .test.ts
3. If you want do write test for that you got testing database included. Every test file name should include .test.ts
